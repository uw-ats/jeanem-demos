          <p>
            If you use the same password for different purposes, a cyberthief can learn the password from a less secure
            site or application and then use it to exploit other accounts. So never reuse your UW NetID password on any
            other account, and avoid re-using passwords across accounts in general.

          <p>Anti-virus software can help protect computers and devices from various forms of infection, but it must be
            kept up to date. Members of the UW community can install a free version of Sophos anti-virus for home use
            and
            for unmanaged University-owned computers and devices.</p>

            <li>Links in email may lead to malicious web pages where malware may be downloaded on to your computer.</li>
            <li>Links in email may also lead to phony login pages, even ones that look just like the official UW login
              page, where your credentials may be harvested to send spam or infiltrate UW information systems.</li>
            <li>Phony login pages may be crafted to look like your bank account, Office 365, Adobe, or other financial
